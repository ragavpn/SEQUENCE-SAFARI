# SEQUENCE-SAFARI

The first task of DELTA

This game consits of 3 modes:
  1. Normal Mode
  2. Hacker Mode
  3. Hacker++ Mode

Normal Mode - The snake moves around the board and eats a sequence of colors. If it messes up the order, the game ends. After eating one whole sequence of colors correctly, it's score increases by 1. The highest score is stored as well and on screen buttons are provided as well. There is a timer system, and if the time runs out the game ends. If the snake eats the color sequence correctly, the timer gets incremented by some time.

Hacker Mode - The game further has a lives system: when a snake dies, it loses a life. When all the lives are depleted, the game ends. As the score increases, make the snake move faster and increases it in size. There are power-ups that spawn randomly and gain buffs on eating them, such as shrinking the snake and slowing it down. There is a pause button as well.

Hacker++ Mode - The game has obstacles moving in the game and if the snake ats it, the game ends. There is a portal in the game through which the snake can travel through to come out of the other portal.There is a save game feature which allows you to save the game and relaod to its eact state which can be accessed after pausing the game. This is a dual mode where there are two snakes with separate words to complete and scores to increases and high scores to achieve. This will be different for both the players but their common goal is to beat the timer by getting the words correctly and getting some time. If a snake collides into the other one, it loses a life.

Choose any mode and play and have fun with it.
